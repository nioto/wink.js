And go to <http://localhost:8080/test/>

*  <http://localhost:8080/test/winkjs/api.js)> is the location the generated code for the Rest services from <https://github.com/nioto/wink.js/tree/master/src/test/java/org/nioto/ws>.

* <http://localhost:8080/test/generate> page of live tests for the samples services from <https://github.com/nioto/wink.js/tree/master/src/test/java/org/nioto/ws>. Data is set randomly in the servlet, just reload to change these values.
