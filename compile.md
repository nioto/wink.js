## Compilation

### I use maven to compile the source code

Just retrieve the source of the project, and do : 

```bash
mvn package
```

#### Note :
The pom.xml use Wink v.1.2.1-incubating for compilation, if you want to use Wink v.1.3.0 just replace, in pom.xml, the part :

```xml
<wink.version>1.2.1-incubating</wink.version>
```
by

```xml
<wink.version>1.3.0</wink.version>
```
